# python-challenge synopsis of both challenges

1) PyBank Challenge
  
  In this challenge, the task includes creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. A set of financial data called budget_data.csv as given. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Final script both prints the analysis to the Terminal and exports a text file with the results.


2) PyPoll Challenge 

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

A set of poll data is given called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

    The total number of votes cast

    A complete list of candidates who received votes

    The percentage of votes each candidate won

    The total number of votes each candidate won

    The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script both prints the analysis to the Terminal and exports a text file with the results.
